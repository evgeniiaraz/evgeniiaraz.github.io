Hi everyone!
</span>

<br/>
<br/>

I'll try to post here from time to time about some research ideas which I learnt about recently and found interesting. And sometimes about PhD life in general. 
<br/>
<br/>
You might find this blog useful:
<ul>
 <li> if you're looking for paper summaries on certain topics, probably, on multilingual NLP, dialogue and linguistics;</li>
 <li> if you'd like to learn about  student life in several places -- I've lived and studied in Scotland, England, Germany and the US;</li>
 <li> if you're interested in learning about my research in a less academic, more reader friendly manner (hopefully);</li>
</ul>
I can't promise:
<ul>
 <li> that the posts will be regular (but will try my best);</li>
 <li> that the posts will be only about research -- there might be some thoughts about PhD life, moaning about ever failing experiments etc;</li>
 <li> that the blog will be an exhaustive directory with all the papers on a topic;</li>
</ul>
