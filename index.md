Iâ€™m a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind, where I work on responsible evaluation and data quality measurement. Before that, I completed my PhD at the [LTL](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Ivan VuliÄ‡](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/).  Previously I did machine learning research internships at Google Research, [PolyAI](https://poly.ai/) and [Rasa](https://rasa.com/). I got my Masters degree from [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University and my BSc at the University of Edinburgh. 


Outside of my current research, I am broadly interested <b>natural language processing and large language models</b> (LLMs) in both monolingual and multilingual contexts. Iâ€™m especially curious about how to extend these models <b>across domains and languages</b> in data-efficient ways. Iâ€™m also passionate about improving the <b>controllability and responsible use of LLMs and conversational AI</b>.
