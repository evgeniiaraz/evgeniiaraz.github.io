I am a first year PhD student at the [LTL](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge. Previously I did an internship at [Rasa](https://rasa.com/), a Masters degree at [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I did my BSc at the University of Edinburgh. 

I am interested in all things about languages, maths and their beautiful intersections such as computational linguistics. In my time off, I really enjoy arts, music and long walks üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
