I am a final year PhD student at the [LTL](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) at University of Cambridge. I am supervised by [Dr. Ivan VuliÄ‡](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/).  Previously I did machine learning research internships at Google Research, [PolyAI](https://poly.ai/) and [Rasa](https://rasa.com/). I got my Masters degree from [LTI](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University and my BSc at the University of Edinburgh. 


I am interested in <b>natural language processing and understanding</b> both in monolingual and multilingual settings. My research so far focuses on <b>dialogue systems</b> and how they can be extended <b>across domains and languages</b>. I am also interested in improving <b>controllability and factuality of the dialogue systems</b>. In my time off, I really enjoy arts, movies, music and long walks. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by email or DM me on Twitter!
